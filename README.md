Lets you see colors on your Notepad++

### Installation

### Bugs
* -- is treated like a comment instead of a subtraction operation
* #'s are not properly colored
Please notify me about missing functions so that I can add them to the XML file

### FAQ
**Q:** Can you make this for Sublime?<br/>
**A:** I don't use sublime so I can't help much, however given how easy it is to open the XML file there's nothing stopping you from grabbing all the function names and adding them yourself<br/><br/>
